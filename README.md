# pymybase #

This is more of a set of base classes helpful for doing things.  These classes are used through several projects to simplify things, like logging (MyLoggingBase), exporting to csv from json (JSON2CSV), threading (MyThread), and a sqlite db (MyDb).

I enjoy this stuff, so please let me know if you have any questions/comments/conserns.
